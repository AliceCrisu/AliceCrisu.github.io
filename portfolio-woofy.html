                    or tell you where it is.</p>

                <p>The main problem is that many people lose their dog and it takes a long time before
                    they realize that their dog is no longer in their area, and the time to find the dog is
                    long. Every minute the dog is lost increases the rate that the dog will spot something.</p>

                            Andreea is 33 years old and works as a software engineer. Since she was confined to a wheelchair a few years ago, her best friend is Rudy, her dog. Maricica lives at the house with the garden and Rudy always digs under the fence and leaves the yard. This happens because of Rudy's unspent energy. For this reason, Andrea is afraid of losing Rudy and wants to help her friend to consume his energy in a better way.

              <p>We tried to observe people that participated in the interview both interacting with their dogs, but also simulated the unfortunate event that they lose their pet.</p>
              <p>With the help of a user journey map we emphasised with the intervieweees and understood the impact that each of these events can have on them. 
                This was an extremely useful step in creating an application that is as efficient as possible in achieving its goals.

            <p>Woofy is a project that aims to connect dogs with their owners, evenmoreso during training.</p>
            
            <p>It's crucial that the application is simple enough even if the app is used during a dog training session, where your focus cannot be fully directed to your phone. 
              Another important aspect is being able to quickly find your dog in case it gets lost. </p>

            <p>
              I think I managed to achieve both of these goals, by creating an app with large, specific, UI elements, 
              but also by facilitating the connection with other users that might find themselves in closer proximity to your dog, 
              in case it gets too far away from you.
            </p>
