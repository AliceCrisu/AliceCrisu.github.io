                  <li>I had to do research, to understand who the targeted people are and how they use an application at the gym.</li>
                  <li>At the same time, I had to understand what is the most important information that a gym manager wants to see and discover what their main problems are</li>

                  <li>For the site, I had to create a simple interface, which would focus on information and which would not distract much attention from the complexity of the concept.</li>
                  <li>For the application, I had to be careful that the charts were easy to understand, the information was placed in the right place, and the links between the exercises and the information related to them were easy to read</li>

                <p> I have to build a solid image of the concept/business. As a result, an easy-to-understand presentation site is needed, which includes all the key information and is easy to navigate and understand. On the other hand, the application must be for users who go to the gym. As a result, a lot of informative information must be included, the exercises must be visible, and the exercise tracking must be easy to access and see. </p>

He thinks that if he could more easily see the progress he has or if he could find a personal trainer to put him to sleep, it would be easier for him to be constant in going to the gym.

                I justified all actions that interviewees have pointed out and tried to see how their lives can be improved both by the product
                but also by a user interface that would facilitate the transition to a new way of managing and displaying information. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Building a user journey has helped us emphatise with the clients and see the issues that they might encounter when trying to complete their tasks.

              <p>The finished UI is a result of understanding and addressing all of the user's pain points. </p>
              <p> In terms of UX, we managed to compress complex information into an intuitive application, with a dynamic interface, 
                both for the trainees that want to check on their personal progress and compete with others,
                as well as for the personal trainers that would like to optimise their workflow with existing clients but also and find new clients with ease. </p>

              <p> In regards to the landing page, aimed at presenting the business to the world, I managed to give it a simple, readable interface, making the content easy to navigate and understand </p>
