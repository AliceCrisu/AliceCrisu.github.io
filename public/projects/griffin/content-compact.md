## Overview

Griffin is a strategic operations platform that centralizes cash flow management, transactions, customer data, and marketing operations into a single system. It supports business-critical workflows and real-time collaboration across teams. The platform is designed to provide clarity, control, and scalability in complex operational environments.

## Problem

Before Griffin, the business relied on a legacy in-house platform combined with multiple external tools to analyze key metrics. The ecosystem was fragmented, difficult to navigate, and limited to static data visualization. This led to inefficient workflows, high onboarding costs, and poor visibility across platforms and teams.

## Challenge

A key challenge was preserving the core value of the legacy platform while removing its rigid structure and usability issues. At the same time, multiple external tools needed to be consolidated into a single, scalable system. The platform had to support heavy data, advanced configuration, and diverse user roles while remaining intuitive and cohesive.

## Discovery & Platform Audit

The discovery phase focused on auditing the legacy platform and surrounding tools to understand critical workflows and structural pain points. Special attention was given to data hierarchy, permissions, and cross-platform relationships. This process helped define what needed to be retained, simplified, or restructured.

## Architecture & Platform Structure

Research revealed the need for a dual-branch architecture to support different types of actions. The platform was structured around user-dependent actions (such as permissions and account management) and system-level actions (such as configuration and setup). This distinction became foundational to the information architecture and interaction model.

## User, Roles & Business Alignment

Griffin is a B2B platform used by operational, managerial, and executive users with different access levels and needs. Research showed that even experienced users struggled to find relevant data quickly, especially in large tables. To address this, direct interactions within tables and page-specific filtering were introduced to improve efficiency and collaboration.

## Wireframing & Interaction Design

Low-fidelity wireframes were used to explore navigation, layouts, and interaction patterns for data-heavy views. Testing confirmed that a single layout could not support all use cases. As a result, multiple layout types were defined to balance detailed analysis and high-level overviews while maintaining consistency.

## Flexibility & Editing Capabilities

A core objective was to enable advanced editing and configuration without breaking user flow. Flexible page structures were designed to support customization while following shared interaction principles. A clear layout system was established, separating navigation, content, and contextual editing into distinct areas.

## Validation & Design System

Validated designs were translated into a scalable design system that ensured visual and functional consistency. This approach simplified development handoff and supported future platform expansion without compromising usability.

## Validation, Iteration & Handoff

The platform was continuously refined through stakeholder feedback and usability insights. Final iterations focused on clarity, documentation, and close collaboration with development teams. This ensured a smooth implementation aligned with both user needs and business goals.
