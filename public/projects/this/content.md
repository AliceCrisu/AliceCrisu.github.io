## Why is my portfolio listed as a project?

You'll find my portfolio listed as a project for two simple reasons.

### First: transparency.

In most projects, you can only read about my process. Here, you can actually test it. Everything I talk about is right in front of you — you can navigate the site, feel the flow, notice where certain decisions were implemented and understand how they were designed.

Nothing is hidden behind slides or explanations. What you see is what I do.

### Second: this is not just another portfolio.

Technical skills matter, of course, but they're not the whole story. What feels far more important to me is showing how I think, how I understand users, and the mindset I bring when designing interfaces.

This project exists because I see a common problem with standard UX portfolios: they often showcase polish and execution, but very little of the human side — the reasoning, the empathy, the thinking behind the work.

Finding a UX designer can feel exhausting when everything looks impressive, yet nothing feels personal. This portfolio is my attempt to solve that problem.

## Inspiration & Visual Direction

The inspiration came from a desire to make the site feel more like a magazine or a brochure than a traditional portfolio. Large text, attention-grabbing headlines, and a subtle touch of brutalism set the tone.

You might notice how simple everything is — very few colors, no shiny effects, no visual noise. That choice was intentional.

For me, breathing space matters. Content matters more than decoration.

People who land on my site usually have a very clear need: someone who can help them understand their users better and design solutions that align with business goals. Overloading them with visual stimuli would only steal attention away from what actually matters — the substance of the work — and tire the reader with unnecessary visual information.

## The Hero Section

The hero section is special to me. It's the very first interaction — with the site, and with me.

I wanted it to feel like a small moment of connection. If you read the first paragraph and decide to "turn on the light," you've already taken a step closer to sharing your idea and the problem you're trying to solve.

That microinteraction is our first conversation.

From a UX perspective, microinteractions help capture attention and build engagement — as long as they don't become overwhelming. This was my way of gently inviting you in, sparking curiosity, and setting the tone for what you're about to explore.

## Projects Section

Let's be honest — you're here to see whether my work aligns with your business needs.

After that initial interaction, the projects section becomes the heart of the site, taking up the largest portion of the content. Clear visuals, meaningful titles, and short descriptions are there to help you quickly decide which project resonates most with your current challenge.

You might notice that the portfolio project itself sits last in the hierarchy. That's not accidental.

Most languages are read left to right, often following a Z-pattern. However, our eyes naturally gravitate toward the center of an image or layout to understand context faster. When two projects sit higher in the hierarchy, they compete for attention. This project, by stretching across the full width lower down, feels calmer and easier for the brain to process — making the decision feel more comfortable, not forced.

## Project Pages: Structure & Content

When I first saw how much content each project page contained, my honest reaction was:

**"This is scary. Nobody has time to read all of this."**

That reaction was a clear UX signal.

We live in a fast-paced world with limited attention. Opening a page where information feels endless can easily overwhelm users. So I introduced a toggle at the beginning of each project page.

You choose how deep you want to go.

If you just want to understand my way of working, feel free to read the short version. If you're interested in the technical details and deeper analysis, the extended version is always there.

I'm not here to steal your time with information that doesn't help you — or worse, confuses you.

## The Carousel

Starting a project page with a carousel might feel unusual, right?

Actually, it makes a lot of sense.

When reviewing portfolios, people tend to focus deeply on one main project. The rest are usually scanned to get an overall sense of skills and capabilities. For that reason, it felt unnecessary to make you scroll through the entire page just to see all the visuals.

The carousel is there to optimize your journey — giving you quick visual context without friction.

And if you're still here reading this, I'll take it as a small win 🙂

## Closing Thoughts

Building this portfolio taught me something I already knew but sometimes forget: design isn't about showing off — it's about showing up for people.

Every choice here, from the toggle switches to the carousel, was made with you in mind. Not to impress you, but to respect your time and help you find what you need without friction.

If this resonates with how you think about design — if you believe that empathy, clarity, and intentionality matter more than decoration — then we're probably going to work well together.

And if you've read this far? I'm genuinely grateful. It means something landed.

**Let's talk.**
