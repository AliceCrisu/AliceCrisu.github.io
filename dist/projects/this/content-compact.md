## Why is my portfolio itself a project?

My portfolio is listed as a project for two simple reasons: transparency and intention. This is the one place where you don’t just read about my process — you can experience it directly by navigating the site and interacting with it. Everything you see here reflects how I think and how I design.

## Inspiration & Visual Direction

The site is inspired by magazines and brochures rather than traditional portfolios. Large typography, strong headlines, and subtle brutalist touches help guide attention and create rhythm.

The visual simplicity is intentional. Fewer colors and less decoration leave room to breathe, allowing the content and ideas to take center stage.

## The Hero Section

The hero section is the first interaction with the site — and with me. It was designed as a small moment of connection, gently inviting you into the experience.

The microinteraction acts as our first conversation. It’s there to spark curiosity, capture attention, and set a calm, intentional tone for what follows.

## Projects Section

The projects section is the heart of the site, where most of the story lives. Clear visuals, meaningful titles, and short descriptions help you quickly find what’s relevant to your needs.

The portfolio project appears last on purpose. By giving it more space and reducing visual competition, the decision feels easier and more natural, rather than forced.


### Project Pages: Structure & Content

Seeing how much information each project contained raised an important UX question about attention and overwhelm. To address this, each project page starts with a toggle that lets you choose how much detail you want to explore.

You can read a short version for a quick understanding, or dive deeper into the full analysis when it feels useful. The goal is to respect your time, not compete for it.

### The Carousel

Starting a project page with a carousel might seem unusual, but it’s intentional. When browsing portfolios, people tend to focus deeply on one project and scan the rest for context.

The carousel offers quick visual clarity without forcing unnecessary scrolling. If you’re still here reading this, I’ll take it as a small sign that the journey worked.
This portfolio is not meant to be a polished showcase of skills alone. More than execution, it’s about showing the human side of my work — the reasoning, empathy, and mindset behind each decision.

## Closing Thoughts

Building this portfolio taught me something I already knew but sometimes forget: design isn't about showing off — it's about showing up for people.

Every choice here, from the toggle switches to the carousel, was made with you in mind. Not to impress you, but to respect your time and help you find what you need without friction.

If this resonates with how you think about design — if you believe that empathy, clarity, and intentionality matter more than decoration — then we're probably going to work well together.

And if you've read this far? I'm genuinely grateful. It means something landed.
